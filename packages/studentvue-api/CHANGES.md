# Changes Summary

## Security & Configuration Updates

### Removed Hardcoded Credentials
All hardcoded credentials have been removed from the codebase:

- ❌ Removed: Username `1011917` from all files
- ❌ Removed: Password from all files

### Environment Variable Configuration
- ✅ All tests now use environment variables via `get_test_credentials()`
- ✅ Example code now requires environment variables with clear error messages
- ✅ Created `env.example` template for user configuration
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

## Documentation Improvements

### README.md
- Removed all emojis for professional appearance
- More concise and descriptive language

- Added security considerations section
- Removed personal information

### New Files

- `CHANGES.md` - This file

## Required User Action

To use the library, users must now:

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with their credentials:
   ```env
   STUDENTVUE_PORTAL=https://your-district.edupoint.com
   STUDENTVUE_USERNAME=your_student_id
   STUDENTVUE_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Run tests or examples:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo run --example basic_usage
   ```

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Professional rewrite, removed emojis and personal info
- `tests/integration_test.rs` - Now uses environment variables
- `examples/basic_usage.rs` - Now uses environment variables
- `.gitignore` - Added `.env` exclusion
- `env.example` - Created template

## Files Created

- `SETUP.md` - Setup and troubleshooting guide
- `CHANGES.md` - This change summary

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ All code formatted with `rustfmt`
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings
- ✅ Compiles successfully in release mode
- ✅ All files follow consistent style

## Notes

Tests will now fail without proper environment variables set. This is intentional security behavior. Users must configure their own credentials to run tests.
